                <li>Back pain is very common, and most cases are not due to serious injury and will improve within days to a few weeks.</li>
                <li>Outside of a small minority of people who suffer from a slipped disc or nerve impingement, the most common causes of back pain are due to the structures that provide movement to your back - the joints, ligaments and muscles.</li>
