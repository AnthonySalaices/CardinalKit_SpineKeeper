            <ul style="padding-left:25px;">
                <li>Try the following modifications in your daily activities:</li>
                  <ul style="padding-left:25px;">
                    <li>Sitting – Choose a chair and position that is comfortable. Try out different chairs and positions. You can place some support in the lower curvature of your back. Get up and stretch regularly.</li>
                    <li>Desk Work – Adjust the height of your chair to fit the desk. Adjust your keyboard and screen to minimize strain to your back, neck and forearms. Get up and stretch regularly.</li>
                    <li>Driving – Adjust your seat occasionally and try placing support in the lower curvature of your back. If you plan on driving for a long time, make sure to take stretch and walking breaks.</li>
                    <li>Lifting – Do not lift more than you need to. Think and plan how you will lift something. Keep the weight of the load close to your body. Do not twist your abdomen while you are lifting, but turn with your feet.</li>
                    <li>Carrying and shopping – Don’t carry anything if you don’t need to – use shopping carts. Carry things close to your body and balance the weight between both hands.</li>
                    <li>Sports – You may need to lower your intensity, but do continue with your sport of choice. Swimming is a good alternative – try different strokes to vary your movements.</li>
                    <li>Sleeping – Some people report pain relief with firmer mattresses. Take your time to experiment and find the right fit. If the pain is preventing you from sleep, try a pain killer an hour before.</li>
                    <li>Sex – Continue your usual sexual activity and try different positions.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
