            <h1>23andMe Module Informed Consent</h1>
            <p>The MyHeart Counts mission is to study activity, fitness and cardiovascular health in the general population in order to understand various aspects of heart health. We hope to find new and better ways to prevent heart disease. Sharing your genetic data with us helps us to understand disease better. If you have genetic data from 23andMe, please consider agreeing to share the data with Stanford University. If you agree to share your genetic data with MyHeart Counts, you are allowing us to store your coded data on Stanford University servers and to analyze your genetic data for research purposes. We may recontact you through email to let you know about new research updates and/or new app features.</p>
            <p><strong>Possible risks and benefits when it comes to genetic information:</strong></p>
            <p>Your privacy is of the highest importance to us, and we will use safety measures to protect it. Despite all of the safety measures that we will use, we cannot guarantee that your identity will never become known.</p>
            <p>To prevent improper access, we will use a random code instead of your name for the main study data, and this coded study data will be encrypted and stored on a secure cloud server run by Sage Bionetworks, a non-profit research organization. Your coded genetic information will be stored on a secure server run by Stanford University, an academic research institution. While your coded data in this database will not contain information that is traditionally used to identify you, people may develop ways in the future that could allow someone to link your health information in this database back to you. For example, someone could compare information in this database with information from you in another database and be able to identify you. It is also possible that there could be violations to the security of the computer systems used to store the codes linking your health information to you. However, your privacy is very important to us, and the study will make every effort to protect your privacy and the privacy of your data, but that cannot be completely guaranteed. Your coded data (without your name) will be combined with data from other participants for analysis by Stanford researchers and their research partners. You also have the option to allow your coded study data (i.e., without your name) to be shared with other qualified researchers who meet criteria established by Stanford. Stanford will maintain your consent and personal information and the link to your study data to enable future research.</p>
            <p>Benefits that may reasonably be expected to result from this study are that you will be given the opportunity to use a mobile health application and learn more about your activity, fitness and heart risk.  We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study.  Your decision whether or not to participate in this study will not affect your employment or medical care.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Your personal information is being requested. Please choose carefully.</strong></p>
            <p>At the end of this form ResearchKit will request that you authorize its MyHeart Counts app to use and disclose your coded genetic data from your 23andMe account.</p>
            <p>23andMe does not endorse or promote any specific app. You must choose whether to allow 23andMe to release the requested data based on your own comfort.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Participants Rights:</strong></p>
            <p>If you have read this form and have decided to participate in this project, please understand your participation is voluntary and you have the right to withdraw your consent or discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.</p>
            <p>The results of this research study may be presented at scientific or professional meetings or published in scientific journals.  However, your identity will not be disclosed.<p>
            
            <p><strong>Questions, Concerns, or Complaints:</strong></p>
            <p>If you have any <strong>questions, concerns or complaints</strong> about this research study, its procedures, risks and benefits, or alternative courses of treatment, you should ask the Protocol Director, Dr. Euan Ashley at 1-650-721-3944. You should also contact him at any time if you feel you have been hurt by being a part of this study. If you decide to share the data with us and then later change your mind, please contact <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/myheartcounts/support.html">myheartcounts.stanford.edu</a> and we will ensure that future use and sharing of your data ceases, however we cannot undo research that has already been done using your data up to that time.</p>
            <p><strong>Independent Contact:</strong> If you are not satisfied with how this study is being conducted, or if you have any concerns, complaints, or general questions about the research or your rights as a participant, please contact the Stanford Institutional Review Board (IRB) to speak to someone independent of the research team at 1-650-723-5244 or toll free at 1-866-680-2906.  You can also write to the Stanford IRB, Stanford University, 3000 El Camino Real, Five Palo Alto Square, 4th Floor, Palo Alto, CA 94306.</p>
            <p>Please print a copy of the consent form for your records. You can find a printable version of the consent <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/content/dam/sm/myheartcounts/images/23andme-Module-final-printable-23andme-module-consent.pdf">here</a>.</p>
