    <p>We view your privacy very seriously. Thus, we are requesting the least amount of personal data possible. Also, we are using strict security protocols to protect your data. Importantly, your name will be replaced with a random code before the data goes to the large computer for storage and later analysis. We cannot completely guarantee that someone cannot gain access to your private data, but importantly the main data storage is secure, encrypted, and does not contain your name.</p>

    The app is currently intended for use in only the United States. If you travel outside of the country during the study, then you should not use the app during such travels.

    As described elsewhere in the informed consent form, during the study, data pertaining to your participation in the study will be generated and recorded, including data about your health. We refer to such data as “Your Study Data.”  Your Study Data may be processed or used for the following purposes, which we refer to, collectively, as “Data Processing”:
    
    <ul>
        <li>to carry out the study;</li>
        
        <li>to confirm the accuracy of the study;</li>
        
        <li>to monitor that the study complies with applicable laws as well as best practices developed by the research community;</li>
        
        <li>to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, including requirements that data from this study, without information that could directly identify you, be made available to other researchers not affiliated with the study sponsor or with the study team.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    It is possible, for example, that as part of efforts to make research data more widely available to researchers, regulatory authorities in some countries may require that Your Study Data, without information that could directly identify you, be made publicly available on the internet or in other ways.
    The following entities and organizations may engage in Data Processing that uses Your Study Data:
    <ul>
        <li>the study team, including other people who, and organizations that, assist the study team;</li>
        <li>the ethics committee or institutional review board that approved this study;</li>
        <!--li>Sage Bionetworks, a research entity that operates the secure cloud server in which Your Study Data are stored, and any other similar entities that are used to store or protect your data; and</li-->
        <li>domestic and foreign regulatory agencies and government officials who have a duty to monitor or oversee studies like this one.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    Some of the entities listed above that receive Your Study Data for Data Processing are located in the United States and potentially in other countries where, the laws do not protect your privacy to the same extent as the laws in your country of residence.  In such cases, Data Processing that involves Your Study Data may be subject to the less restrictive data protection laws of these foreign countries rather than the laws of your own country.  However, all reasonable steps will be taken to protect your privacy.
