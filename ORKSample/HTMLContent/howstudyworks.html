            <p>If you provide consent, you will be asked to allow the Stanford Spine Research app to collect health and activity data from your phone or wearable device, plus answer survey questions about any history of back pain disease and risk factors.</p>
            
            <p>The app will ask you to complete a number of activities and surveys, and will also passively collect activity data. After the first day will take you less than 5 minutes to complete daily tasks. The Stanford Spine Research app will provide you with feedback, about how your activity and pain compare to others. You can continue to use the app for activity monitoring and tips for  back pain excercises to try. The Stanford Spine Research app will also provide educational links to learn more about any of your data. You may also be asked to try different ways to help you improve your activity and back health. </p>
