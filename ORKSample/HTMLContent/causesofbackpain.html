            <ul style="padding-left:25px;">
                <li>Your spine is among the strongest parts of your body. Your spine consists of solid bony vertebra, cushioned by flexible discs, bound by multiple ligaments and supported by large muscles. With these structures, it is surprisingly difficult to damage the spine.</li>
                <li>Most causes of back pain come from the structures that provide movement to the back – the joints, ligaments and muscles. The key to recovery is to resume natural and usual movement.</li>
                <li>Despite what you might have heard:</li>
                  <ul style="padding-left:25px;">
                    <li>A very small minority of people with back pain have a slipped disc or nerve impingement. In those few cases, the symptoms usually resolve with conservative treatment involving continued movement and exercise. Very few people with back pain ever need to resort to surgery.</li>
                    <li>Most doctors and therapists will not be able identify the specific source of your pain. You should generally consider that good news, as it likely indicates you have no serious damage to the spine.</li>
                    <li>X-rays and MRI scans can help identify serious spinal injuries but are often misleading and unhelpful for usual cases of back pain. Terms such as “degeneration” may sound alarming, but usually indicate signs of natural aging, not acute damage or arthritis.</li>
