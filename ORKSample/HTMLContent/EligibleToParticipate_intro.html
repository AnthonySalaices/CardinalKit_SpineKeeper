            <h1>Eligibility</h1>
            <p>All adults living in the United States, United Kingom and Hong Kong are eligible. This study works most optimally with iPhone versions 5s or higher, as these have special motion sensors built in that do not drain your battery. Finally, you need to be able to read and understand English. Versions in other languages and for more countries outside the U.S., United Kingom and Hong Kong will be available in the future.</p>
