                <p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> You are invited to participate in a research study on identifying the best motivational prompts to get people more physically active.</p>
                <p><strong>PROCEDURES:</strong> With your permission, we would like to collect a baseline week of data (such as the answers to app survey questions, activity data from HealthKit such as step count, heart rate –if available) and then randomly assign you to receive an activity motivating prompt that you will receive through the app and will ask you to complete a very short daily check in survey. The prompts that you will help us test are: </br>1) a reminder to stand up and move for 60 seconds </br>2) daily information about the level of activity group that you fall into based on the data collected when you signed up for the app </br>3) a daily prompt to read about heart health at the American Health Association website and </br>4) a daily reminder to walk more when you are behind on the 10k steps a day goal. You will receive all four prompts, each prompt will last a week and each week one of the four prompts will randomly be assigned to you.</p>
