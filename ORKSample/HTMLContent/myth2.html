   <p>Myth: Getting just 1 hour less sleep per night than needed will not have any effect on your daytime functioning.

    <ul style="padding-left:25px;">
                    <li>This lack of sleep may not make you noticeably sleepy during the day. But even slightly less sleep can affect your ability to think properly and respond quickly, and it can impair your cardiovascular health and energy balance as well as your bodyâ€™s ability to fight infections, particularly if lack of sleep continues. If you consistently do not get enough sleep, a sleep debt builds up that you can never repay. This sleep debt affects your health and quality of life and makes you feel tired during the day.</li>
