            <ul style="padding-left:25px;">
                <li>While there is no miracle cure, there are treatments that should allow you to control the pain enough to make you feel better and help return you to an active life.</li>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <li>Pain killers:</li>
                  <ul style="padding-left:25px;">
                    <li>Safe use of over-the-counter painkillers is effective to mask the pain to enable you to return to activity. Acetaminophen is a safe and effective pain killer. You can also use anti-inflammatory pain killers like Ibuprofen. Ask your physician which medication would be best for you.</li>
                 </ul>
                <li>Heat and cold:</li>
                  <ul style="padding-left:25px;">
                    <li>Both heat and cold can used for short-term relief of pain and muscle tension. You can try applying a cold pack wrapped in a damp towel where it is sore every 10 minutes or as needed for the first 48 hours. Alternatively, you can use a warm compress, bath or a shower to temporarily relief pain.</li>
                 </ul>

                <li>Massage:</li>
                  <ul style="padding-left:25px;">
                    <li>Gentle massage on the area of pain can help relieve pain and relax the muscles.</li>
                 </ul>

                <li>Manipulation:</li>
                  <ul style="padding-left:25px;">
                    <li>There is general agreement that manipulation, done safely by a qualified professional (e.g. osteopaths, chiropractors, physiotherapists, doctors with special training), can help relieve back pain. Just a few sessions should be enough. Prolonged manipulation is discouraged.</li>
                 </ul>

                <li>Other treatment:</li>
                  <ul style="padding-left:25px;">
                    <li>Some people have found other treatments, such as electro-therapy machines, acupuncture, or alternative medicines, helpful for back pain. While most of these treatments rarely provide lasting pain relief, they may be helpful in the short-term and are not necessary for extended use. Getting you back to normal movement and activity is the priority.</li>
                 </ul>
