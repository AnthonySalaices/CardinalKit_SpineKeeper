<p>Your initial participation in this study will last 28 days, though we are hopeful you will continue using the app to monitor your activity. We may also ask you to try methods, such as coaching through the app, to encourage you to increase activity and back pain symptoms. If you participate in this study, there may be additional costs to you. These include the personal time it will take to respond to the survey questions and perform the study tasks.
