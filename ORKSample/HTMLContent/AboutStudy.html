            <p>Welcome to the Stanford SpineKeeper Study!</p>
            <p>We are asking you to join in a global study of spine health. Through your phone (or wearable band or smartwatch), we make it easy to “donate” data about your physical activity and sleep, and assess your fitness and risk factors, to better understand how to have a healthy back. </p>
            <p>Being active every day helps to has been shown to help reduce back pain, and now we can measure activity in much more detail with smartphones and wearable devices. With your help, we can better our understanding of back pain and spine health. Combining your data with friends, family, and many others, you can help us determine how to keep our backs healthy over a long life. </p>
