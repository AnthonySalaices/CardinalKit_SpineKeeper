            <ul style="padding-left:25px;">
                <li>Most cases of back pain are not due to any serious disease.</li>
                <li>While aches and pains can last for quite a long time, acute back pain usually improves within days to a few weeks. Once the acute pain subsides, most people regain full function, even with some remaining pain.</li>
                <li>About half of the people who experience back pain will get it again within two years. This is common and should not be cause for alarm.
How you react to a back pain episode is very important. Resting more than a day or two will not help and instead may prolong the pain.</li>
                <li>Your body is built for movement. Make sure to keep moving and return to your daily activities as soon as you can even if some pain remains.</li>
