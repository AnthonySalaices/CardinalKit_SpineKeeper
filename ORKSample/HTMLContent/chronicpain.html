                <li>Much research has been done to help identify people at risk for long-term pain and disability. As you will see below, most of these signs are how people feel and how they react to their pain.</li>
                <li>Signs of people at risk of long-term pain:</li>
                  <ul style="padding-left:25px;">
                    <li>Believing that hurt means harm</li>
                    <li>Believing you will be disabled</li>
                    <li>Believing you have serious damage or injury, and not accepting of reassurance</li>
                    <li>Avoiding activity due to fear of causing damage</li>
                    <li>Extended rest and inactivity</li>
                    <li>Believing someone or something outside of yourself else can fix the pain</li>
                    <li>Feeling depressed and withdrawn</li>
                </ul>
                <li>These thoughts and behaviors develop gradually. It is important to notice them and act on them early. Please use the information in this app to guide you through the actions necessary to relieve and successfully cope with back pain. You may find additional help and resources with your doctor or therapist. Staying off from work over a month raises your risk of developing long-term problems. The goal is not to delay your recovery to normal daily activities.</li>
