<p><strong>PURPOSE OF RESEARCH:</strong>You are invited to participate in a research study on the use of a mobile application-based lifestyle modification intervention targeted at patients with chronic low back pain. We hope to learn whether such an app can improve quality of life and symptoms. You were selected as a possible participant in this study because you reported that you have had low back pain for 6 months.</p>
<p>Mobile phones and wearable devices can now measure physical activity and fitness, offering improved methods to research the impact of activity and fitness. The goal of this study is to use the quantitative capabilities and wide availability of mobile devices to enhance our knowledge of the relationships among activity, quality of life, and back pain.</p>
<p>We anticipate enrolling 100 patients at sites of their choosing through the iOS mobile application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION: </strong>Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary.  Your decision not to participate will not have any negative effect on you or your medical care.  You can decide to participate now, but withdraw your consent later and stop being in the study without any loss of benefits or medical care to which you are entitled. If you decide to withdraw your consent to participate in this study, you may discontinue use of the app at any time (delete the app).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DURATION OF STUDY INVOVEMENT:</strong>Your initial participation in this study will last 28 days, though we are hopeful you will continue using the app to monitor your activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURES:</strong>You will be asked to download the Stanford SpineKeeper app on your smartphone and go through screens that will determine eligibility, describe the study to you, and ask you to provide informed consent. If you provide consent, a copy of this consent form will be emailed to you. You will then be asked to allow the Stanford SpineKeeper app to collect health and activity data from your phone, followed by questions about your physical activity and any history or symptoms of back pain and risk factors.  You should check with your doctor before enrolling in the study to make sure you are ok to participate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the beginning of the study, you may choose among or choose to be assigned to 2 tracks for management of your low back pain. The tracks include one focused on relaxation and symptom management, and another track on increasing activity. The tracks include 28 days of exercises and education to help you learn how to manage your back pain. Each day, you will also be asked to answer questions or perform app based measurements of your function to help track your progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Stanford SpineKeeper app will also provide educational links to learn more about any of your data. The Stanford SpineKeeper app will continue to collect activity data and you can continue to use the app to view your data. If you first agree to participate and then you change your mind, you are free to withdraw your consent and discontinue your participation at any time.  Your decision will not affect your ability to receive medical care for your disease and you will not lose any benefits to which you would otherwise be entitled. If you decide to withdraw your consent to participate in this study, you may discontinue use of the app at any time. If you withdraw from the study, or the use of the app is stopped for any reason, there will be no side-effects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required by U.S. Law.  This website will not include information that can identify you.  At most, the website will include a summary of the results.  You can search this website at any time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PARTICIPANT RESPONSIBILITIES: </strong>As a participant, your responsibilities include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Follow the instructions on the mobile app.</li>
    <li>Tell the Protocol Director or research staff if you believe you might be pregnant.</li>
    <li>Ask questions as you think of them.</li>
    <li>Tell the Protocol Director or research staff if you change your mind about staying in the study.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WITHDRAWAL FROM STUDY: </strong>If you first agree to participate and then you change your mind, you are free to withdraw your consent and discontinue your participation at any time.  Your decision will not affect your ability to receive medical care for your disease and you will not lose any benefits to which you would otherwise be entitled. If you decide to withdraw your consent to participate in this study, you may discontinue use of the app at any time. If you withdraw from the study, or the use of the app is stopped for any reason, there will be no side-effects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Protocol Director may also withdraw you from the study, without your consent for one or more of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Failure to follow the instructions of the Protocol Director or study staff.</li>
        <li>The Protocol Director decides that continuing your participation could be harmful to you.</li>
        <li>Pregnancy</li>
        <li>The study is cancelled.</li>
        <li>Other administrative reasons.</li>
        <li>Unanticipated circumstances</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will NOT access your personal contacts, other applications, personal photos, texts, or email messages. At times during the study, the app may provide additional methods to encourage you to increase your activity level, or the ability to share your data with family or friends (with your permission). You may also be re-contacted in the future about additional research opportunities, including adding other health data to your Stanford SpineKeeper app data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>POSSIBLE RISKS, DISCOMFORTS, AND INCONVENIENCES: </strong>There are risks, discomforts, and inconveniences associated with any research study. You should talk with the Protocol Director if you have any questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The study involves tracks which include one focused on relaxation and symptom management, and another track on increasing activity. The tracks include 28 days of exercises and education to help you learn how to manage your back pain.</p>
<p>There are potential risks associated with exercises including chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath as well as more serious potential risks such has heart attack.  There is also the possibility of other risk that are not anticipated. Back pain may get worse with increasing activity.</p>
<p>To prevent improper access, we will use a random code instead of your name for the main study data and this coded study data will be encrypted, sent to the research team via secure email, and stored on a secure Stanford server. While your coded data in this database will not contain information that is traditionally used to identify you, people may develop ways in the future that could allow someone to link your health information in this database back to you. For example, someone could compare information in this database with information from you in another database and be able to identify you. It also is possible that there could be violations to the security of the computer systems used to store the codes linking your health information to you. However, your privacy is very important to us and the study will make every effort to protect your privacy and the privacy of your data, but that cannot be completely guaranteed. Your coded data (without your name) will be combined with data from other participants for analysis by Stanford researchers. Identifiers might be removed from identifiable private information and, after such removal, the information could be used for future research studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies without additional informed consent from you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Stanford SpineKeeper app is currently intended only for use in the United States. If you travel outside of these countries during the study, then you should not use the app during such travels.</p>
